      <h2>Importance of Forests</h2>
      <img src="images/forest1.jpg" alt="Forest" />
      <p>
        Forests are crucial to the health of our planet. They play a vital role
        in regulating the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide, producing oxygen,
        and maintaining the water cycle. Forests provide habitat for a diverse
        range of species and are essential for biodiversity.

    <section id="threats-to-forests">
      <h2>Threats to Forests</h2>
      <img src="images/forest2.jpg" alt="Threats to Forests" />
      <p>
        Deforestation, climate change, and pollution are major threats to
        forests worldwide. These activities lead to habitat destruction, loss of
        biodiversity, and contribute to global warming.

    <section id="conservation-efforts">
      <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
      <img src="images/forest3.jpg" alt="Conservation Efforts" />
      <p>
        Conservation efforts include establishing protected areas, promoting
        sustainable forestry practices, and engaging local communities in
        conservation activities. Reforestation and afforestation projects are
        also critical in restoring degraded forest areas.

    <section id="biodiversity-in-forests">
      <h2>Biodiversity in Forests</h2>
      <img src="images/forest4.jpg" alt="Biodiversity in Forests" />
      <p>
        Forests are home to a vast array of plant and animal species. The rich
        biodiversity in forests provides ecosystem services such as pollination,
        seed dispersal, and soil formation. Protecting forest biodiversity is
        essential for maintaining ecosystem balance.

    <section id="protecting-animals">
      <h2>Protecting Animals on Land</h2>
      <img src="images/forest5.jpg" alt="Protecting Animals" />
      <p>
        Protecting animals on land is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and
        ecosystem health. Many species face threats from habitat loss, poaching,
        and climate change. Conservation programs and protected areas are vital
        for the survival of endangered species.
