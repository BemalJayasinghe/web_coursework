                <p>The importance of sustainable natural resource management for both social and economic development is emphasized in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Oceans, seas, freshwater resources, forests, mountains, drylands, biodiversity, ecosystems, and wildlife are all highlighted as being extremely important to preserve.

                    The specific objectives of Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15) are to combat desertification, preserve, restore, and encourage the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems; stop and reverse land degradation; and stop the loss of biodiversity. Mountains are identified as ecosystems that require conservation, restoration, and sustainable use in Target 1 of SDG 15.
                    
                    The Future We Want, the Rio + 20 Conference outcome document, recognizes the benefits of mountains for sustainable development, particularly their role in supplying water resources to a large portion of the global population. It acknowledges mountains as home to native peoples and nearby communities and draws attention to how vulnerable they are to natural disasters, deforestation, climate change, and land degradation. The document calls on states to implement coordinated efforts and comprehensive, long-term plans that incorporate national sustainable development strategies with policies tailored specifically to mountainous areas.

                    Sustainable mountain development was a topic of discussion prior to Rio+20 at a number of UN gatherings and conferences, such as the 2002 International Year of Mountains. The significance of mountains as sources of vital resources, energy, water, and biodiversity is also emphasized in Agenda 21's Chapter 13. While stressing how much of the world's population depends on mountain resources, especially water, it also draws attention to the quick changes in the environment and degradation that is occurring in mountain regions..</p>
